# Solutions-Dump
My dump of solutions from HackerRank, CodeChef, CodeForces etc.\
File names are same as the titles of the questions, so it'd be easy to navigate. There are more solutions I'll add them eventually (I'm lazy lol).

**Accounts**: [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/Vivek_Kolhe?hr_r=1), [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/profile/Vivek_Kolhe), [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/users/vivek_kolhe).

***Note:*** I can't say all the solutions are correct (because I've just copied and pasted them from Hackerrank and whatever site's editor, don't know whether I copied the wrong or the correct solution.) and efficient, if you've a better one, initiate a PR. And yes I haven't yet participated in any competition lol, these are just practice questions.
